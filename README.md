- *LTL learning on GPUs*, by [M. Valizadeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mojtaba-valizadeh-phd-3b98b67a/), [N. Fijalkow](https://games-automata-play.com/) and
[M. Berger](https://martinfriedrichberger.net/). Draft: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12373

The paper will appear at CAV 2024 (36th International
Conference on Computer Aided Verification) in July 2024.  The file 

- `cav-2024-submission-5511.zip`

contains all the code. The code has been tested on Google Colab. We will add a detailed description of how to run it on Colab before CAV.

The directory `benchmarks` contains all the benchmarks used in the paper. The construction of our benchmarks is described in Section 7. Our benchmarks use the  trace format described in
